 There are multiple notebooks each with different tasks. Multiple excel files containing some outputs from the tasks.
 
 
 This study is a series of experiments attempting
to classify emotions from a collection of videos annotated with
the help of a survey. There are broadly three approaches; the
first employs a Convolutional Neural Network, and the second
combines a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature
descriptor and ML models like SVM, KNN and Random Forest.
The third approach uses an off-the-shelf, open-source python
library, ’FER’, to classify the emotions from videos. FER-2013
and CK+ datasets are used to train models separately. Finally, the
results from the experiments are compared to find the techniques
that perform better on videos and images. It observed that models
perform significantly better on images compared to videos. The
paper discusses the challenges that arise when dealing with video
data and possible reasons that cause accuracy to fall when videos
are analyzed compared to images.
